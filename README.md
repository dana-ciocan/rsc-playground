# Learning React Server Components

I've been reading and listening to podcasts about React Server Components for ages. I think I'm getting it, but I want to prove out my learning so I'm going to build a simple app to solidify what I've learned.

I'm going to do a talk at work about it and hopefully write a blog post too!
